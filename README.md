# NeuralNetwork
A simple neural network.<br>
This repository contains a neural network with backpropagation.

Some sample results
---
You train a neural network that has **two** input neurons, **four** hidden neurons and **one** output neuron.<br>
The input is represented by two numbers between 0 and 1. The expected output should be the addition of the two numbers.<br>
<br>Example:<br>
Data which the network was trained with:

<table>
<tr>
<th>input one</th>
<th>input two</th>
<th>expected output</th>
<th>calculated output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>0.4</td>
<td>0.4002</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.3</td>
<td>0.8</td>
<td>0.7998</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>0.7</td>
<td>0.9</td>
<td>0.8999</td>
</tr>
</table>
